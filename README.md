This is just a mini project to solve a problem which I face often. When we download multiple files from the same source , sometimes their names are similar to this:
file1-  'unnecessarylongcommonpart-chapter1.pdf'
file2-  'unnecessarylongcommonpart-chapter2.pdf'
file3-  'unnecessarylongcommonpart-chapter3.pdf'

When there are a large number of files, its difficult to manually rename them. This application does that for you in seconds.

After running this is what we get:

file1-  'chapter1.pdf'
file2-  'chapter2.pdf'
file3-  'chapter3.pdf'

>How to Use:

1)Make a folder containing all the files of similar category. (same source)
2)Open this Python script and change the folder location to your folder location.( Dont forget to use double slashes in the address)
3)Save and Run 

That's it ! All the files' names will only contain the identifying parts.

>Future Changes:

I feel opening the script and changing the folder location is a little irritating. The desirable usage will be something like this - Right click on the folder having the files and Select option for our application.
