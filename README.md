This is just a mini project to solve a problem which I face often. When we download multiple files from the same source , sometimes their names are similar to this:
<br />
file1-  'unnecessarylongcommonpart-chapter1.pdf'<br />
file2-  'unnecessarylongcommonpart-chapter2.pdf'<br />
file3-  'unnecessarylongcommonpart-chapter3.pdf'<br />
<br />
When there are a large number of files, its difficult to manually rename them. This application does that for you in seconds.
<br />
After running this is what we get:<br />
<br />
file1-  'chapter1.pdf'<br />
file2-  'chapter2.pdf'<br />
file3-  'chapter3.pdf'<br />

>How to Use:

1)Make a folder containing all the files of similar category. (same source)<br />
2)Open this Python script and change the folder location to your folder location.( Dont forget to use double slashes in the address)<br />
3)Save and Run<br /> 

That's it ! All the files' names will only contain the identifying parts.<br />

>Future Changes:<br />
<br />
I feel opening the script and changing the folder location is a little irritating. The desirable usage will be something like this - Right click on the folder having the files and Select option for our application.
